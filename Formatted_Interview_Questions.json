        "answer": "The one common trait between Node.js, AJAX, and jQuery is that all of them are the advanced implementation of JavaScript. However, they serve completely different purposes.\n\n* Node.js –It is a server-side platform for developing client-server applications. For example, if we’ve to build an online employee management system, then we won’t do it using client-side JS. But the Node.js can certainly do it as it runs on a server similar to Apache, Django not in a browser.\n\n* AJAX (aka Asynchronous Javascript and XML) –It is a client-side scripting technique, primarily designed for rendering the contents of a page without refreshing it. There are a no. of large companies utilizing AJAX such as Facebook and Stack Overflow to display dynamic content.\n\n* jQuery –It is a famous JavaScript module which complements AJAX, DOM traversal, looping and so on. This library provides many useful functions to help in JavaScript development. However, it’s not mandatory to use it but as it also manages cross-browser compatibility, so can help you produce highly maintainable web applications.\n\n**Source:** _techbeamers.com_"

        "question": "What are the key features of Node.js?",
        "answer": "Let’s look at some of the key features of Node.js.\n\n*   **Asynchronous event driven IO helps concurrent request handling –** All APIs of Node.js are asynchronous. This feature means that if a Node receives a request for some Input/Output operation, it will execute that operation in the background and continue with the processing of other requests. Thus it will not wait for the response from the previous requests.\n*   **Fast in Code execution –** Node.js uses the V8 JavaScript Runtime engine, the one which is used by Google Chrome. Node has a wrapper over the JavaScript engine which makes the runtime engine much faster and hence processing of requests within Node.js also become faster.\n*   **Single Threaded but Highly Scalable –** Node.js uses a single thread model for event looping. The response from these events may or may not reach the server immediately. However, this does not block other operations. Thus making Node.js highly scalable. Traditional servers create limited threads to handle requests while Node.js creates a single thread that provides service to much larger numbers of such requests.\n*   **Node.js library uses JavaScript –** This is another important aspect of Node.js from the developer’s point of view. The majority of developers are already well-versed in JavaScript. Hence, development in Node.js becomes easier for a developer who knows JavaScript.\n*   **There is an Active and vibrant community for the Node.js framework –** The active community always keeps the framework updated with the latest trends in the web development.\n*   **No Buffering –** Node.js applications never buffer any data. They simply output the data in chunks.\n\n**Source:** _techbeamers.com_"

        "answer": "Node provides a single thread to programmers so that code can be written easily and without bottleneck. Node internally uses multiple POSIX threads for various I/O operations such as File, DNS, Network calls etc.\n\nWhen Node gets I/O request it creates or uses a thread to perform that I/O operation and once the operation is done, it pushes the result to the event queue. On each such event, event loop runs and checks the queue and if the execution stack of Node is empty then it adds the queue result to execution stack.\n\nThis is how Node manages concurrency.\n\n**Source:** _codeforgeek.com_"

Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background. When one of these operations completes, the kernel tells Node.js so that the appropriate callback may be added to the poll queue to eventually be executed.\n\n**Source:** _blog.risingstack.com_"

    {
        "question": "How to avoid callback hell in Node.js?",
        "answer": "Node.js internally uses a single-threaded event loop to process queued events. But this approach may lead to blocking the entire process if there is a task running longer than expected.\n\nNode.js addresses this problem by incorporating callbacks also known as higher-order functions. So whenever a long-running process finishes its execution, it triggers the callback associated. \n\nsometimes, it could lead to complex and unreadable code. More the no. of callbacks, longer the chain of returning callbacks would be.\n\nThere are four solutions which can address the callback hell problem.\n\n**Make your program modular**\n\nIt proposes to split the logic into smaller modules. And then join them together from the main module to achieve the desired result.\n\n**Use async mechanism**\n\nIt is a widely used Node.js module which provides a sequential flow of execution.\n\nThe async module has <async.waterfall> API which passes data from one operation to other using the next callback.\n\nAnother async API <async.map> allows iterating over a list of items in parallel and calls back with another list of results.\n\nWith the async approach, the caller’s callback gets called only once. The caller here is the main method using the async module.\n\n**Use promises mechanism**\n\nPromises give an alternate way to write async code. They either return the result of execution or the error/exception. Implementing promises requires the use of <.then()> function which waits for the promise object to return. It takes two optional arguments, both functions. Depending on the state of the promise only one of them will get called. The first function call proceeds if the promise gets fulfilled. However, if the promise gets rejected, then the second function will get called.\n\n**Use generators**\n\nGenerators are lightweight routines, they make a function wait and resume via the yield keyword. Generator functions uses a special syntax <function* ()>. They can also suspend and resume asynchronous operations using constructs such as promises or <thunks> and turn a synchronous code into asynchronous.\n\n**Source:** _techbeamers.com_"

An exception that has bubbled all the way up to the `Process` level means that your application, and Node.js may be in an undefined state, and the only sensible approach would be to restart everything.\n\nThe preferred way is to add another layer between your application and the Node.js process which is called the [domain](http://nodejs.org/api/domain.html).\n\nDomains provide a way to handle multiple different I/O operations as a single group.

The safest way to respond to a thrown error is to shut down the process. In a normal web server, the better approach is to send an error response to the request that triggered the error, while letting the others finish in their normal time, and stop listening for new requests in that worker.\n\n```js\nvar domain = require('domain');\nvar d = domain.create();\n// Domain emits 'error' when it's given an unhandled error\nd.on('error', function(err) {\n    console.log(err.stack);\n    // Our handler should deal with the error in an appropriate way\n});\n\n// Enter this domain\nd.run(function() {\n    // If an un-handled error originates from here, process.domain will handle it\n    console.log(process.domain === d); // true\n});\n\n// domain has now exited.

To fix this, we need *domains*. Domains provide an asynchronous try...catch.\n\n```js\nvar validateObject = function (obj) {\n    if (typeof obj !== 'object') {\n        throw new Error('Invalid object');\n    }\n};\n\ntry {\n    validateObject('123');\n}\ncatch (err) {\n    console.log('Thrown: ' + err.message);\n}\n```\n* **Error callback** - returning an error via a callback is the most common error handling pattern in Node.js. Handling error callbacks can become a mess (callback hell or the pyramid of doom).\n\n```js\nvar validateObject = function (obj, callback) {\n    if (typeof obj !== 'object') {\n        return callback(new Error('Invalid object'));\n    }\n    return callback();\n};\n\nvalidateObject('123', function (err) {\n    console.log('Callback: ' + err.message);\n});\n```\n* **Error emitting** - when emitting errors, the errors are broadcast to any interested subscribers and handled within the same process tick, in the order subscribed.\n\n```js\nvar Events = require('events');\nvar emitter = new Events.EventEmitter();\n\nvar validateObject = function (a) {\n    if (typeof a !== 'object') {\n        emitter.emit('error', new Error('Invalid object'));\n    }\n};\n\nemitter.on('error', function (err) {\n    console.log('Emitted: ' + err.message);\n});\n\nvalidateObject('123');\n```\n* **Promises** for async error handling\n\n```js\ndoWork()\n.then(doWork)\n.then(doError)\n.then(doWork)\n.catch(errorHandler)\n.then(verify);\n```\n* **Try...catch with async/await** - ES7 Async/await allows us as developers to write asynchronous JS code that look synchronous.\n\n```js\nasync function f() {\n\n  try {\n    let response = await fetch('http://no-such-url');\n  } catch(err) {\n    alert(err); // TypeError: failed to fetch\n  }\n}\n\nf();\n```\n\n* **Await-to-js lib** - async/await without try-catch blocks in Javascript\n\n```js\nimport to from 'await-to-js';\n\nasync function main(callback) {\n    const [err,quote] = await to(getQuote());\n\n    if(err || !quote) return callback(new Error('No Quote found');\n\n    callback(null,quote);\n\n}\n```\n\n**Source:** _gist.github.com_"

        "answer": "Keeping the API declaration separated from the network related configuration (port, protocol, etc) allows testing the API in-process, without performing network calls, with all the benefits that it brings to the table: fast testing execution and getting coverage metrics of the code. It also allows deploying the same API under flexible and different network conditions. Bonus: better separation of concerns and cleaner code.\n\nAPI declaration, should reside in app.js:\n\n```js\nvar app = express();\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\napp.use(\"/api/events\", events.API);\napp.use(\"/api/forms\", forms);\n```\nServer network declaration, should reside in /bin/www:\n\n```js\nvar app = require('../app');\nvar http = require('http');\n\n/**\n * Get port from environment and store in Express.\n */\n\nvar port = normalizePort(process.env.PORT || '3000');\napp.set('port', port);\n\n/**\n * Create HTTP server.\n */\n\nvar server = http.createServer(app);\n```\n\n**Source:** _github.com/i0natan/nodebestpractices_"

Node.js was not designed to run with any other Javascript engine and, in fact, all the native code bindings that come with node.js (such as the fs module or the net module) all rely on the specific V8 interface between C++ and Javascript.\n\nThere is an effort by Microsoft to allow the Chakra Javascript engine (that's the engine in Edge) to be used with node.js. Node.js can actually function to some extent without V8, through use of the node-chakracore project.

        "answer": "**V8** is a JavaScript engine built at the google development center, in Germany. It is open source and written in C++. It is used for both client side (Google Chrome) and server side (node.js) JavaScript applications.\n\nV8 was first designed to increase the performance of the JavaScript execution inside web browsers. In order to obtain speed, V8 translates JavaScript code into more efficient machine code instead of using an interpreter. It compiles JavaScript code into machine code at execution by implementing a **JIT (Just-In-Time)** compiler like a lot of modern JavaScript engines such as SpiderMonkey or Rhino (Mozilla) are doing. The main difference with V8 is that it doesn’t produce bytecode or any intermediate code.\n\n**Source:** _nodejs.org_"

        "question": "What is the purpose of using hidden classes in V8?",
        "answer": "JavaScript is a prototype-based language: there are no classes and objects are created by using a cloning process. JavaScript is also dynamically typed: types and type informations are not explicit and properties can be added to and deleted from objects on the fly. \n\nAccessing types and properties effectively makes a first big challenge for V8. Instead of using a dictionary-like data structure for storing object properties and doing a dynamic lookup to resolve the property location (like most JavaScript engines do), V8 creates** hidden classes**, at runtime, in order to have an internal representation of the type system and to improve the property access time.\n\n**Source:** _thibaultlaurens.github.io_"
    },
    {
        "question": "How V8 compiles JavaScript code?",
        "answer": "V8 has two compilers:\n\n* A **“Full” Compiler** that can generate good code for any JavaScript: good but not great JIT code. The goal of this compiler is to generate code quickly. To achieve its goal, it doesn’t do any type analysis and doesn’t know anything about types. Instead, it uses an Inline Caches or “IC” strategy to refine knowledge about types while the program runs. IC is very efficient and brings about 20 times speed improvment.\n\n* An **Optimizing Compiler** that produces great code for most of the JavaScript language. It comes later and re-compiles hot functions. The optimizing compiler takes types from the Inline Cache and make decisions about how to optimize the code better. However, some language features are not supported yet like try/catch blocks for instance. (The workaround for try/catch blocks is to write the “non stable” code in a function and call the function in the try block)\n\nV8 also supports **de-optimization**: the optimizing compiler makes optimistic assumptions from the Inline Cache about the different types, de-optimization comes if these assumptions are invalid. For example, if a hidden class generated was not the one expected, V8 throws away the optimized code and comes back to the Full Compiler to get types again from the Inline Cache. This process is slow and should be avoided by trying to not change functions after they are optimized.\n\n**Source:** _thibaultlaurens.github.io_"

        "question": "How does libuv work under the hood?",
        "answer": "There is only one thread that executes JavaScript code and this is the thread where the event loop is running provided by **libuv**. The execution of callbacks (know that every userland code in a running Node.js application is a callback) is done by the event loop.\n\nLibuv by default creates a thread pool with four threads to offload asynchronous work to. Today’s operating systems already provide asynchronous interfaces for many I/O tasks (e.g. AIO on Linux).\nWhenever possible, libuv will use those asynchronous interfaces, avoiding usage of the thread pool.\n\nThe event loop as a process is a set of phases with specific tasks that are processed in a round-robin manner. Each phase has a FIFO queue of callbacks to execute. While each phase is special in its own way, generally, when the event loop enters a given phase, it will perform any operations specific to that phase, then execute callbacks in that phase's queue until the queue has been exhausted or the maximum number of callbacks has executed. When the queue has been exhausted or the callback limit is reached, the event loop will move to the next phase, and so on.\n\n*   **timers**: this phase executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`.\n*   **pending callbacks**: executes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration.\n*   **idle, prepare**: only used internally.\n*   **poll**: retrieve new I/O events; execute I/O related callbacks (almost all with the exception of close callbacks, the ones scheduled by timers, and `setImmediate()`); node will block here when appropriate.\n*   **check**: `setImmediate()` callbacks are invoked here.\n*   **close callbacks**: some close callbacks, e.g. `socket.on('close', ...)`.\n\n<div class=\"text-center\"/>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ROxiavz7LeRpIfcgRDE7CA.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" style=\"max-width: 500px\" />\n</div>\n\n\n**Source:** _nodejs.org_"

        "question": "How does the cluster module work? What’s the difference between it and a load balancer?",
        "answer": "The cluster module performs fork from your server (at that moment it is already an OS process), thus creating several slave processes. The cluster module supports two methods of distributing incoming connections.\n\n* The first one (and the default one on all platforms except Windows), is the round-robin approach, where the master process listens on a port, accepts new connections and distributes them across the workers in a round-robin fashion, with some built-in smarts to avoid overloading a worker process.\n\n* The second approach is where the master process creates the listen socket and sends it to interested workers. The workers then accept incoming connections directly.\n\nThe difference between a cluster module and a load balancer is that instead of distributing load between processes, the balancer distributes requests.\n\n**Source:** _imasters.com_"

        "answer": "A template is a blueprint for JavaScript functions and objects. You can use a template to wrap C++ functions and data structures within JavaScript objects. V8 has two types of templates: Function Templates and Object Templates.\n\n* **Function Template** is the blueprint for a single function. You create a JavaScript instance of template by calling the template’s GetFunction method from within the context in which you wish to instantiate the JavaScript function. You can also associate a C++ callback with a function template which is called when the JavaScript function instance is invoked.\n\n* **Object Template** is used to configure objects created with function template as their constructor. You can associate two types of C++ callbacks with object templates: accessor callback and interceptor callback. Accessor callback is invoked when a specific object property is accessed by a script. Interceptor callback is invoked when any object property is accessed by a script. In a nutshell, you can wrap C++ objects\\structures within JavaScript objects.\n\n**Source:** _blog.ghaiklor.com_"

        "question": "Why Node.js devs tend to lean towards the Module Requiring vs Dependency Injection?",
        "answer": "Dependency injection is somewhat the opposite of normal _module design_. In normal module design, a module uses `require()` to load in all the other modules that it needs with the goal of making it simple for the caller to use your module. The caller can just require() in your module and your module will load all the other things it needs.\n\nWith dependency injection, rather than the module loading the things it needs, the caller is required to pass in things (usually objects) that the module needs. This can make certain types of testing easier and it can make mocking certain things for testing purposes easier.\n\nModules and dependency injection are orthogonal: if you need dependency injection for testability or extensibility then use it. If not, importing modules is fine. The great thing about JS is that you can modify just about anything to achieve what you want. This comes in handy when it comes to testing.\n\n**Source:** _reddit.com_"
